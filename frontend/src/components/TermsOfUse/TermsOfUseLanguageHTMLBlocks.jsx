        <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION AND CHOICE</h2>
        <p>
          “Personal information” is information about a natural person that
          identifies or describes an individual, including, but not limited to,
          his or her name, social security number, physical description, home
          address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, and
          medical or employment history, readily identifiable to that specific
          individual. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not
          considered personal information, however, it is considered
          “electronically collected personal information.”
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Government Code § 11015.5., “electronically collected
          personal information” means any information that is maintained by an
          agency that identifies or describes an individual user, including, but
          not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical
          description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial
          matters, medical or employment history, password, electronic mail
          address, and information that reveals any network location or
          identity, but excludes any information manually submitted to a State
          agency by a user, whether electronically or in written form, and
          information on or relating to individuals who are users, serving in a
          business capacity, including, but not limited to, business owners,
          officers, or principals of that business.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Electronically collected personal information” that we automatically
          collect includes your domain name or Internet Protocol address, and
          statistical information about which web pages you visit. If you
          voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for specific
          information (i.e., completing a request for assistance, personalizing
          the content of the web site, sending an e-mail, or participating in a
          survey) more detailed data will be collected. If you choose not to
          participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect
          your ability to use any other feature of the web site.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any type of personal information is requested on the web site or
          volunteered by the user, State law, including the Information
          Practices Act of 1977, Government Code Section 11015.5., and the
          federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information
          may be a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to
          public inspection and copying if not otherwise protected by federal or
          State law.
        </p>
        <h2>A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN</h2>
        <p>
          Children are not eligible to use services that require submission of
          personal information, and we require that minors (under the age of 13)
          do not submit any personal information to us. This includes submitting
          personal information to the City as part of a user profile or
          personalization profile. If you are a minor, you can use these
          services only if used together with your parents or guardians. If you
          are a minor, you should seek guidance from your parents.
        </p>
        <h2>INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW IT IS USED</h2>
        <p>
          We do collect personal information directly from individuals who
          volunteer to use some of our services. Collection of this information
          is required to deliver the specific services, but use of these
          services is voluntary.
        </p>
        <p>

          automatically collect and store in our logs about your visit helps us
          to analyze our web site to continually improve the value of the
          materials available. Our web site logs do not identify a visitor by
          personal information, and we make no attempt to link other web sites
          with the individuals that browse the City’s web site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Government Code § 11015.5.(a)(6) prohibits all state agencies from
          distributing or selling any electronically collected personal
          information, as defined above, about users to any third party without
          the permission of the user. The State does not sell any
          “electronically collected personal information.” Any distribution of
          “electronically collected personal information” will be solely for the
          purposes for which it was provided to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The City may provide or distribute certain lists and statistical
          reports of regulatory information as provided by law, but no personal
          information is sold or distributed, and all relevant legal protections
          still apply to the City’s web sites.
        </p>
        <h2>WHAT HAPPENS TO INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT TO US?</h2>
        <p>

          it was provided and will not be shared with another entity except as
